* why buttons are not disabled? (add button is not disabled when exceeding 25 shapes. Delete button is not enabled
  when shapes are selected)
* Why doesn't the form labels & input boxes align perfectly?
* Why we need to click on the same shape twice when switching the currently selected shape from one type to another?
  (e.g., currently selecting a square, first click on a cat reset the edit view to message view, then second click
  selects the shape)

* Take a look at the editShapeView.css, editMessageView.css, style.css? Not shown in the solution video.

* What is the mockup folder in the solution directory?
